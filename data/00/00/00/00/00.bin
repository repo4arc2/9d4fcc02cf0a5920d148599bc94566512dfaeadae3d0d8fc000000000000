Now get inside, buddy.
Come on, Lila, let's go.

321
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,166
Huh? What's with this face?

322
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,541
You have a cut on your forehead, Dad.

323
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,750
What's going on?
Should we be worried?

324
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:29,666
No, no. It's nothing. Daddy's got this.
It's no big deal. Okay? Come on.

325

(LILA SIGHS)

326
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,375
I really thought you were gonna be
home for Christmas.

327
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,958
Hey, look at me.
I'll be home for Christmas.

328
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,708
-Promise me. Promise?
-Yeah, okay.

329
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,416
I said Coop's in charge,

330
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,000
he's not. You're in charge.

331
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,416
You always have been.
Look after these boys.

332
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,916
Merry Christmas. See you soon.

333
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,416
-Keep your word, okay?
-BARTON: I will. I promise.

334
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,750
-You guys be safe, okay?
-Okay.

335
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,416
Call me when you get home? I love you.

336
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,666
NATHANIEL: Bye, Dad.

337
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,666
COOPER: Bye, Dad. Don't worry. I got this.

338
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,583

349

Oh, my God. Wait. Wait, they think I...
They think I'm that... vigilante?

350
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:44,458
It's been less than 24 hours,
you've been on the news twice. Impressive.

351
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,416
Told you that suit was bad news.

352
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,708
Clint, I gotta go.

353
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,375
Uh, no, no, no. That is, uh,
the last thing you need to do, actually.

354
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,250
Let's not forget the Tracksuit guys
trying to kill you twice yesterday.

355
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:03,541
I'm going to find this suit,
and until I do, you're gonna stay put.

356
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,625
It's not safe, obviously.

357
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,958
Not showing up at work is not safe.

358
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,666
My mom is already high strung.

359
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,583
Surprised she hasn't called me already.

360
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,500
Just stay put, please.

361
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:19,583
Look, if I stay put,
she's just gonna come and find me, anyway.

362
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:23,125
She owns a security company.
It's literally the safest place I can go.

363
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,125
Yeah, no. You're just
not gonna listen to me, are you?

364
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,666
I want to, but no.

365
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,416
Go get changed.

366
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,875
You look silly.

367
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,958
All right, I'll go see what else she has.

368
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,041
I'm gonna be late, thanks to you.

369
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,125
You're gonna be alive 'cause of me.

370
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,416
Hey, man, here you go.

371
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,000
-All right.
-Oh.

372
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,291
Being a gentleman,
walking on the outside. Nice.

373
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,875
No, no, it's just so I can hear you.

374
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,041
And to be clear, not 'cause I want to,

375
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,750
-just 'cause I need to.
-Oh.

376
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:57,875
What happened?

377
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:02,083
-(GROANING)

-No.

That's Katniss Everdeen. Let's go.

386
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,458
Your problem is branding.

387
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,708
No, my problem is you.

388
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,791
And this ninja suit,

389
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,083
and the people trying to kill you
'cause of it.

390
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,583
It's a problem
that I'm going to solve today,

391
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:30,875
so I can go home to my family.

392
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,666
No, it's branding.

393
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,458
Your whole thing is that you're low-key.
It's a very hard brand to sell.

394
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,875
Well, I'm not really trying
to sell anything.

395
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,583
It should technically make you cooler,

396
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,833
but with the scary stuff that's
happened since the Avengers appeared,

397
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,041
people don't want that cynical,
cool thing anymore.

398
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,625
They want sincerity.

399
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,250
-That right?
-Not self-seriousness,

400
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,375
but a heart-on-your-sleeve sincerity.

401
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,916
I see.

402
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,875
You are very contained.
Keep your cards close to your vest,

403
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:01,708
which you wear over a suit of armor and,
like, 16 other layers of self-protection.

404
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,916
All of which, under, finally,
is your heart.

405
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,250
So, not exactly on your sleeve.

406
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,458
Again, not really trying to sell anything.

407
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,500
But you do, anyway.

408
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:17,000
(SIGHS) Yeah, okay, Kate.
Um, what am I selling, then, huh?

409
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,541
It's certainly not Halloween costumes
or toys off the shelf.

410
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,500
Inspiration, Clint.

411
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,166
The office is here. Shall we meet
at the safehouse after work?

412
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,541
Uh...

413
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,083
Uh, if all goes as planned today,

414
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,500
this is gonna be
the last time we see each other.

415
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,666
All you've taught me is how to lose a tail

416
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,000
and I almost already knew that.

417
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,583
Right, maybe I taught you
how to bandage a wound.

418
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,583
-How's that?
-But what about trick arrows?

419
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,791
There are no trick arrows, Kate.

420
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,875
Here, put your phone number in here.
For emergencies only.

421
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,791

-Great. Merry Christmas.

-Okay?

438
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,375
Good morning.

Kate.

440
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:44,375
Sorry for your loss.
I, um, saw it on the news.

441
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,625
Thank you, Kate.
That's very sweet of you.

442
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,375
He was very dear to me.

443
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,291
Must've come as quite a shock.

444
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,708
JACK: It did. (EXHALES)

445
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,000
It did, indeed.

446
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,666
You two were probably really close.

447
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,208
Well, we had a special relationship.

448
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,458
What about the inheritance?

449
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,333

450
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,958
Oh, this, it's, um...

A friend's. Just borrowing it.

452
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,166
What's this I hear about a fire
in your apartment last night?

453
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,583
I can explain. Can we talk?

454
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:23,875
Without the interloper?

455
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,875
-Please.
-No, no, it makes perfect sense

456
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,791
that she would be hostile.

457
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,666
She likely feels displaced by me,

458
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,083
and she's testing our new dynamic.

459
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:38,333
She both desires my approval,
yet wants to set firm boundaries.

She feels threatened by me,
and you know what?

Well, then you have five days
to keep that promise.

634
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,083
Yeah.

635
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,791
I'm missing out on, uh,
gingerbread house construction.

636
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:19,541
Nah, it's okay. You'd have slowed us down.
What's the play?

637
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,166
-A little catch release.
-Nice.

638
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,833
One of Nat's old moves.

639
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,833
<i>-Be careful.</i>
-Yeah.

640
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:36,208
Send me pictures.
I wanna see the disaster.

641
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,500
Time to get myself caught.

You guys, come on. We gotta finish!

644
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,166
That was delicious, Jack. Thank you.

645
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,916
-I'm so glad you liked it.
-KATE: Mmm.

646
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:50,833
The secret to a good risotto is to

647
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,375
agitate it.

648
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,708
Just enough.

649
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:57,625
And then it's just down to
patience and attention.

650
00:33:58,541 --> 00:33:59,541
KATE: Wow.

651
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,083
You cook, you're attentive,
you're wealthy.

652
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,083

KATE: Hmm.

656
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,916
So, it seems you're quite
the sword aficionado, Jack. Do you fence?

657
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:22,916
I dabble.

658
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:27,291
Would you say you're more
an épée, foil, or sabre man?

659
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,708
JACK: Oh.

660
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:30,750
You know your stuff, little lady.

(SCOFFS)

I was a two-time state champion.

663
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,583
Good with all the outdated weapons.

664
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:39,750
Made me aware of when someone
is trying to stab you in the back.

665
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:43,166
Okay, I think you've both proven
that you know what swords are.

666
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,916
-Can we move on now?
-Oh, but, dear,

667
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,041
I think a common interest is
very fertile ground for bonding.

668
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,208
That's exactly what I was thinking.

669
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,083
-Bonding.
-JACK: Mm.

-Let's break out these bad boys.
-Please, let's not, okay?

671
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:04,083
We've had enough drama this week.

672
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,291
Yeah.

673

You know, perhaps...
perhaps your mother is right.

674
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:12,250
Oh, come on, why not?
You've got some spare fencing gear.

675
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,791
-I'm convinced.
-All she said was, "Why not?"

676
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:20,166
That's not a convincing argument.
That's not an argument at all.

677
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,291
And yet...

678
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:25,375
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,833
Wow. You are good.

Nothing. I'm an open book.

What is wrong with you?

700
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,541
He's lying.

701
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:15,041
To be fair, I did downplay my skill

702
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,625
and repeatedly lie about it.

703
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:18,916
She tried to stab you.

704
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,333
No, I knew he would parry.
What I was trying to do was

705
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,833
prove that he is lying,
which I successfully did.

-he ends up murdered by sword?

Is that possible?
